# Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, draw insights to enhance strategic decision-making, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's overall performance.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Sales Data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- Excel

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
